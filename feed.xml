            <title>📊 Community Honor Code - Building Better Gaming</title>
            <description>Our Community Honor Code promotes positive gaming behavior through four core principles: Focus on Growth, Constructive Feedback, Recognize Good Play, and Build Community.</description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[
                <h2>🏛️ Community Honor Code</h2>
                <p>At Dota Player Rating, we believe in fostering a gaming environment where everyone can thrive. Our Honor Code guides every interaction and review on our platform.</p>
                
                <h3>⚖️ Our Four Principles:</h3>
                
                <h4>🌱 1. Focus on Growth</h4>
                <p>Every player is on a journey of improvement. Rate and review with the intention of helping others grow, not tearing them down.</p>
                
                <h4>🔧 2. Constructive Feedback</h4>
                <p>When providing feedback, be specific, actionable, and kind. Focus on behaviors and decisions, not personal attacks.</p>
                
                <h4>🌟 3. Recognize Good Play</h4>
                <p>Celebrate great teamwork, positive attitude, and skillful play. Recognition encourages more positive behavior in our community.</p>
                
                <h4>🤝 4. Build Community</h4>
                <p>We're all part of the same gaming community. Help create an environment where everyone feels welcome and valued.</p>
                
                <h3>🎯 Making a Difference</h3>
                <p>By following these principles, we're not just rating players - we're building a culture of respect, growth, and positivity that makes gaming better for everyone.</p>
