        <summary type="text">Our Community Honor Code promotes positive gaming behavior through four core principles: Focus on Growth, Constructive Feedback, Recognize Good Play, and Build Community.</summary>
        
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[
            <h2>🏛️ Community Honor Code</h2>
            <p>At Dota Player Rating, we believe in fostering a gaming environment where everyone can thrive. Our Honor Code guides every interaction and review on our platform.</p>
            
            <h3>⚖️ Our Four Principles:</h3>
            
            <h4>🌱 1. Focus on Growth</h4>
            <p>Every player is on a journey of improvement. Rate and review with the intention of helping others grow, not tearing them down.</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p><em>"We rise by lifting others up, not by putting them down."</em></p>
            </blockquote>
            
            <h4>🔧 2. Constructive Feedback</h4>
            <p>When providing feedback, be specific, actionable, and kind. Focus on behaviors and decisions, not personal attacks.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>✅ "Great map awareness in mid game!"</li>
                <li>✅ "Consider warding more defensively when behind"</li>
                <li>❌ "This player is terrible"</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>🌟 3. Recognize Good Play</h4>
            <p>Celebrate great teamwork, positive attitude, and skillful play. Recognition encourages more positive behavior in our community.</p>
            
            <h4>🤝 4. Build Community</h4>
            <p>We're all part of the same gaming community. Help create an environment where everyone feels welcome and valued.</p>
            
            <h3>🎯 Making a Difference</h3>
            <p>By following these principles, we're not just rating players - we're building a culture of respect, growth, and positivity that makes gaming better for everyone.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Join the movement:</strong> Rate with purpose, review with kindness, and build community with every interaction.</p>
